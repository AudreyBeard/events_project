[&lt; Back to events help](/help/events)

When you create or edit an event you have the option of hiding the attendees of the event. 

When attendees are hidden only you will be able to see the full list of invites and RSVPs. 

However anyone who can see the event will always be able to see the count of people going and invited to the event.
