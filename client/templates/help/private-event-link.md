# Private Event Link

After creating a private event it can be a hassle to  look up all your invitees phones and emails to invite them.

One easy way to invite your guests is [Bulk invite via email](/help/bulk-invite-via-email). 

Another one is a **private event link**.

Normally no one except you and your invitees can see your private event, but with this link you can share it with anyone. Making it easy to share via text or other social platforms while still maintaining decent privacy.

You can find this link on your event page under the invite button. Click on "copy to clipboard" and share wherever you like.

Keep in mind, anyone who has this link can see the event and RSVP to it. Be careful who you share it with.
