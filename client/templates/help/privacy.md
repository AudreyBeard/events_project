At Juniper City we try to store as little information about you as possible. 

We think it's the right thing for security and privacy.

Information that me might collect:
* The name you provide us
* Your email
* Your phone

You do not need to provide a name. All we require is an email or a phone number.

Information we do collect:
* What events you were invited to.
* What comments you make.
* What groups you are in.


Additionally we use [Clicky](https://clicky.com) for usage analytics of our site. 

We do not store information from Clicky on our server. 

We only use this information to know how many visitors we are getting and what features they use. 

We do not link Clicky data with your user account. 

Clicky however, does provide the following information:
* Device
* Browser
* Country
* Anonymized IP

As stated before, we don't link any Clicky information with your user account. Therefore we can't tie specific visits to our site to your user account. 

You can see more about clicky's privacy options here [https://clicky.com/help/faq/privacy](https://clicky.com/help/faq/privacy)

You can also opt out of Clicky tracking entirely here [https://clicky.com/optout](https://clicky.com/optout)
