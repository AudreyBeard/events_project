# Creating an event

Creating an event in Juniper City is easy. All you need by default is a name, date, and a description for your event.

We suggested putting a location for your event so people can find it.^[You can't currently search events by location.]

You also have a few other options when creating your event. ^[You are able to change any of these settings later if you edit your event.]

## Create event in group

You can optionally attach the event to a group are a member of. You also must be allowed to create an event in that group. Currently only group admins can do this.

## Allow Comments
