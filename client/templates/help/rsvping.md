# RSVPing To an Event


When you are invited to an event you may RSVP in 3 different ways.

1. Going
2. Maybe
3. Not going

You also have the option of hiding your RSVP from everyone attending the event, except the event organizer. 
Even if the event organizer has made the invite list viewable once you RSVP your name will be hidden to everyone but them. 

Public events never show the invite list and hide your RSVP by default for privacy. You may change this by unchecking "Keep my RSVP private" on the event page.
